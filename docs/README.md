In this project, the MSP4302355 was designed to control a thermoelectric plant.  Using a 4x4 keypad the plant could be set to cool, heat, match an ambient temperature, and be turned off.  An ambeint temperature was measured using ADC and displayed on an LCD screen as a moving average over a window size of 3.  The temeprature of the plant was read in over I2C from the LM92 attached to the plant.  this temperature was also displayed on the LCD screen.  When pressing A on the keypad, the plant would enter heat mode and began to warm with the temperature change seen on the LCD along with the mode "Heat".  When B was pressed the plant would cool, the temperature change seen on the LCD and the mode "Cool" displayed.  In both of these modes an I2C transaction was sent to the MSP4302310 controlling the LED Bar.  When the system was heating the bars would fill from the left and when cooling would fill from the right.  When C was pressed on the keypad, the system would heat or cool to match the ambient temperature.  The LED bar would drive the pattern according to the direction the temperature of the plant was being driven.  When the temperature had been matched, the plant would turn off and the LED bar turned off.  Pressing D on the keypad would simply turn off the plant.  The ADC reading and the I2C reading of the plant were both driven off of a 0.5s timer ensuring timely reading of both temperatures.
